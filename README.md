# WTest
- Project example with VIPER-B and MVVM clean (to be developed) architectures. 
- Also contains a module with SwiftUI + combine (to be developed).
- Started as a chalenge for an iOS position, but will be updated during my free time.
- Use Package Manager for downloading all dependecies.

App currently behaviour:
  - Start by downloading a CSV file with postal codes from Portugal.
  - All the data is saved on Realm database.
  - If by some reason the app is closed during the CSV file download, it will recover the process when launched again.
  - The postal codes are presented in a tableView.

Note: Work in progress
